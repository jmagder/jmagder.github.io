<h2>Software Engineer (B.Sc.) with 21+ years professional experience</h2>
<p>
    Hi, I'm Jeffrey Magder. I've worked on projects all over the map from embedded low level driver development in C,
    to enterprise Java based software, to highly interactive Web 2.0 Single Page Apps (SPA) using JavaScript, Node.js
    and associated technologies.  Most recently I cofounded Powder Finance as their principal engineer, which was
    accepted into Y Combinator. We built a plethora of AI tools for RIA's, taking advantage of the promises of GenAI and
    LLMs, saving them time and money, and growing their customer base. Previously I ventured into the world of web3 as
    the founding engineer of Arcade.xyz, where I built an entire web3
    system (crawler, bridge, web app, etc) allowing people to get loans from their NFT collateral. My broad experience has
    given me insight and appreciation to common patterns across the development spectrum in many languages. It continues
    to show me that theories of computation, algorithms, data structures, and general computer science are applicable
    across all domains vertical and horizontal.
</p>

<p>
    Colleagues describe me as an energetic, positive thinker and problem solver who works very well with others. I live
    and breathe technology, and find few things as exciting as furthering its development. My work ethic is strong with
    a proven dedication to product quality and cross-team efficiency. Where possible, I consistently strive for the
    right fix which is not necessarily the ‘quick’ fix. Instead of just fixing the bug at hand, I like to take it many
    steps further by looking for other areas of code that may have the same problems.
</p>

<p>
    It's an exciting time to be in the field, with such rapidly changing landscapes. I'm always interested in hearing
    from like minded companies and individuals who are also interested in moving forward the state of the art as both
    contract and full time opportunities.

<h3>Web Implementation of Desktop Interface</h3>
<p>
    I also welcome you to view my recent web based implementation of a traditional
    <a href="https://jmagder.github.io/webdesktop/" target="_blank">Desktop Interface</a>,
    whose source is available <a href="https://www.github.com/jmagder/desktop_private/" target="_blank">here</a>. The project is
    implemented in React using hooks and local storage for all state management.  It contains a window manager, taskbar
    and taskbar configurator, start menu, a bar chart, pie chart, note taking application, and an NFT Explorer.
